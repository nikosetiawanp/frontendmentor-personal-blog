  <br />
  <p class="text-preset-7 text-neutral-400">
    I'm on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building little
    projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I learn along
    the way.
    <br />
    <br />
    When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me reading, hiking through the mountains,
    or challenging myself on rock-climbing walls. I started this blog to document
    my progress, keep myself accountable, and hopefully inspire anyone else who's
    learning to code. Welcome to my corner of the internet, and thanks for stopping
    by! Latest Articles
