    <h2>Hi, I'm Paulina ðŸ‘‹</h2>
    <p>
      I'm on a journey to become a front-end web developer. I love building
      little projects, trying out new coding techniques, and sharing what I
      learn along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not at my desk, you'll find me reading, hiking through the
      mountains, or challenging myself on rock-climbing walls. I started this
      blog to document my progress, keep myself accountable, and hopefully
      inspire anyone else who's learning to code. Welcome to my corner of the
      internet, and thanks for stopping by!
